    Milestone 1: Foundational Infrastructure Details

Milestone 2: Core ATS Mechanics Details

Shared Infrastructure & Cross-Cutting Capabilities

Schema Mapping
    

    
    # Executive Summary
    This schema translates the Master Plan into a set of highly specific, executable architectural nodes. It isolates the immediate dependency frontier: Milestone 1 (Foundational Infrastructure) and Milestone 2 (Core ATS Mechanics). By formally sequencing Supabase multi-tenancy schemas, Stripe webhook integrations, and Inngest queue bindings before any frontend CRUD or file storage operations are permitted, the schema mathematically enforces the core architectural mandate—eliminating the risk of Vercel serverless timeouts via decoupled, asynchronous compute.
    

    
    # Pipeline Context
    The milestone schema bridges the high-level Master Plan and low-level task executions. It translates the strategic project phases into a strict sequence of architectural nodes. By isolating the 'HOW' into bounded modules, it ensures that cross-cutting concerns (like database migrations, multi-tenant RLS, and async queue configurations) are explicitly established before feature-level UI and AI integration work begins, guaranteeing adherence to our strict dependency rules and mitigating critical timeline risks.
    

    
    # Selection Criteria
    dependency frontier: only milestones whose deps are [✅] or in current batch
    

    
    # Shared Infrastructure
    Supabase Core (Server & Client): Centralized initialization of PostgREST and GoTrue Auth clients to be shared across API routes and React Server Components.

Next.js App Router Core: Foundational request parsing, CORS enforcement middleware, and structured Edge/Node runtime configurations.

Inngest Singleton: Shared event payload typings and client instantiation for dispatching and receiving background jobs across the application.

Stripe Webhook Verifier: Reusable cryptographic signature validation middleware for secure billing synchronization.

Tiktoken Middleware Utility: Programmatic budget constraint module to calculate token counts globally before LLM dispatches.
