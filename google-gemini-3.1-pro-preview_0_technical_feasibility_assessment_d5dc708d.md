# Summary
The baseline architecture is extremely strong for a modern startup, intelligently utilizing best-in-class managed services to maximize the output of a lean 3-person team. Feasibility is highly rated for the core ATS workflows and AI logic. However, ultimate success and adherence to the 4-month timeline hinge entirely on addressing the synchronous LLM processing bottleneck via an event-driven architecture, and aggressively scoping down the external sourcing API requirements. With these architectural and scoping adjustments, the project has a high confidence level for successful, timely delivery.


# Constraint Checklist

## Team
Pass. The 3-person founding team can execute the Next.js/Supabase stack effectively. The heavy reliance on fully managed services and React Server Components maximizes developer velocity, allowing a lean team to build robust, multi-tenant features rapidly without needing dedicated DevOps or backend infrastructure headcount.


## Timeline
At Risk. The 4-month launch deadline is fundamentally insufficient if complex unified APIs (like Merge.dev) or official LinkedIn API approvals are strictly required for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Enterprise integration approvals alone can exceed the entire 16-week project timeline. Adjusting the scope of Sprint 4 to focus on manual ingest or a Chrome Extension fallback is mandatory to meet the deadline.


## Cost
Pass, but requires rigorous monitoring. The underlying serverless architecture (Vercel/Supabase) effectively keeps base compute and infrastructure costs near zero, aligning perfectly with startup constraints. However, the direct per-token cost of utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4o for every parsing and ranking operation introduces severe margin risks. Strict token limits and budget caps per user request must be implemented to ensure SaaS margins are maintained.


## Integration
At Risk. Official job boards and platforms like LinkedIn are notoriously hostile to automated applicant sourcing via unofficial or early-stage channels. Securing access is slow, highly restrictive, and unreliable. The inbound sourcing integration requirement must be pivoted immediately to a companion Chrome Extension for local profile clipping, or delayed to post-MVP in favor of manual uploads.


## Compliance
At Risk. Processing candidate Personal Identifiable Information (PII) through third-party Large Language Models requires strict adherence to data processing agreements. The team must configure OpenAI organization settings to 'Zero Data Retention' to ensure applicant resumes are not used for model training. Furthermore, robust data hard-deletion workflows must be built to handle GDPR and CCPA 'Right to be Forgotten' requests.



# Findings
Vercel Serverless maximum execution limits (10s on Hobby, up to 60s on Pro) are fundamentally incompatible with real-time PDF parsing plus complex LLM chaining, requiring a shift away from synchronous execution.

Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) is perfectly suited for multi-tenant data isolation, eliminating complex backend authorization logic and preventing cross-workspace data leaks.

Stripe webhook management in Next.js is standard and well-supported, but requires durable retry mechanisms if the endpoint fails during an asynchronous subscription upgrade event.



# Architecture
The general Next.js and Supabase architecture is optimal for this team and timeline. However, the system must pivot from a Backend-for-Frontend (BFF) synchronous API paradigm to an Event-Driven architecture. Because of Vercel's serverless timeout constraints, waiting synchronously for a PDF parser and GPT-4o to finish processing is technically unfeasible and will result in 504 Gateway Timeouts. When a resume is uploaded directly to Supabase Storage, a database webhook or storage trigger must invoke an asynchronous background worker (via Edge Functions or an external service like Inngest) to process the `pdf2json` extraction and OpenAI API calls securely in the background. Once finished, Supabase Realtime should push the UI update directly to the client.



# Components
1. Next.js App Router: Serves as the primary UI framework and orchestration layer, utilizing Server Components for performance. 2. Supabase (GoTrue, PostgreSQL, Storage): Acts as the comprehensive Identity and Data layer, handling authentication, relational data, and file storage. 3. Stripe Checkout: Manages recurring billing and subscription tier gating. 4. OpenAI GPT-4o: The intelligence engine powering the core value proposition (candidate scoring, ranking justification, and interview generation). 5. pdf2json: The utility service for extracting raw text from candidate uploads. 6. Vercel: Provides serverless deployment for the frontend and compute functions.



# Data
The application will rely on a relational schema hosted in PostgreSQL. The schema heavily leverages the `pgvector` extension for candidate embeddings, laying the groundwork for semantic matching across historical applicant pools. Crucially, the data model relies on Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) to enforce strict multi-tenant boundaries and prevent cross-workspace data bleed, ensuring that tenant data is isolated at the database query level.



# Deployment
Deployment utilizes Vercel for the Next.js frontend and serverless compute, alongside Supabase Cloud for the database, authentication, and object storage. This pairing provides infinite scalability for stateless compute and highly managed database connection pooling (via PgBouncer). Staging environments are strictly required to validate Stripe webhooks safely and to test complex asynchronous background jobs before production deployment.



# Sequencing
The proposed 4-sprint sequencing is largely logical, mapping out infrastructure, core ATS, and AI integration sequentially. However, Sprint 4 must be fundamentally modified. Native inbound sourcing integrations (LinkedIn/Job Boards) should be completely replaced with UI polish, strict LLM response validation, and edge-case error handling. The critical path must focus on stabilizing the asynchronous task queue rather than expanding the integration footprint.



# Risk Mitigation
To mitigate serverless timeout risks, introduce a durable task queue (e.g., Inngest or Trigger.dev) to handle AI and file parsing tasks asynchronously. To mitigate LLM cost risks and potential payload abuse, utilize the Tiktoken library to accurately estimate token counts before dispatching requests to OpenAI, automatically rejecting massively oversized or maliciously formatted files. To mitigate third-party integration roadblocks, substitute job board APIs with a simpler email-to-ATS or Chrome Extension ingestion method for the initial MVP.



# Open Questions
1. Will the team invest the necessary time to stand up a dedicated background job infrastructure (like Inngest or Trigger.dev), or will they attempt to rely purely on long-running Supabase Edge Functions? 2. How will non-standard PDF formats (e.g., image-based PDFs without embedded text) be handled if a dedicated Optical Character Recognition (OCR) fallback like Tesseract is not included in the initial stack?
