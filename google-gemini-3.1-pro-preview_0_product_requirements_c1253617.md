# Executive Summary
This document outlines the product requirements for an AI-native Applicant Tracking System aimed at SMBs. To meet a strict 4-month MVP deadline with a 3-person team, the plan aggressively descopes risky native job board integrations in favor of a user-operated Chrome Extension for sourcing. Core AI operations (resume parsing, scoring, interview generation) are mandated to run asynchronously via a background queue to eliminate serverless timeout failures. With robust multi-tenancy enforced by Supabase and monetization tightly coupled to Stripe, the platform is structured for immediate viability, scalable reliability, and strong SaaS unit economics.



# MVP Description
The proposed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) is a lightweight, AI-native Applicant Tracking System (ATS) tailored specifically for Small and Medium-sized Businesses (SMBs). Operating under a strict 4-month launch window and constrained to a 3-person engineering team, the MVP aggressively descopes long-tail native integrations and heavy synchronous processing. Core capabilities include asynchronous AI resume screening powered by GPT-4o, an end-to-end pipeline management workflow, a user-driven Chrome Extension for direct candidate sourcing from LinkedIn and other job boards, secure multi-tenant team workspaces protected by Supabase Row Level Security (RLS), and a Stripe-integrated usage-based subscription model. By leveraging a high-velocity tech stack (Next.js, Supabase, Inngest), the platform is designed to provide immediate, automated pipeline productivity without the lock-in and excessive overhead of legacy enterprise ATS platforms.



# User Problem Validation
SMB hiring managers and recruiters consistently experience severe operational friction during the candidate intake and evaluation process. Manual resume review requires disproportionate hours of administrative effort, pulling key personnel away from strategic work. The existing market is heavily bifurcated: enterprise ATS solutions (such as Greenhouse or Lever) are prohibitively expensive, demand complex onboarding, and enforce rigid workflows unsuitable for lean teams. Conversely, standalone generative AI screening tools lack essential end-to-end pipeline tracking and collaborative workspaces, forcing users to constantly switch contexts between tools. There is a validated, critical lack of affordable, intelligent tools that aggregate, process, and rank candidates from diverse sources directly within a cohesive, frictionless tracking environment.



# Market Opportunity
The primary market opportunity lies within the highly underserved SMB segment, specifically targeting organizations with 10 to 250 employees. By positioning the product for tech-forward startups, digital agencies, and lean growth-stage companies, the platform can capture an audience of early adopters who actively seek AI-driven productivity multipliers. This segment requires enterprise-grade intelligence without enterprise-level lock-in, enabling a product-led growth (PLG) strategy where organic adoption is driven by immediate, measurable time-to-hire reductions and clear per-seat or usage-based pricing models.



# Competitive Analysis
The competitive landscape is dominated on the high end by incumbents like Greenhouse and Lever, which offer extensive compliance and reporting workflows but treat generative AI capabilities as expensive, premium add-ons accessible only at the highest pricing tiers. On the lower end, niche AI parsing tools offer rapid screening but entirely lack fundamental applicant tracking functionalities. This product specifically targets the 'missing middle' by providing native AI automation built directly into the core, affordable ATS pipeline. By making intelligent automation the baseline experience rather than an upsell, the platform delivers superior immediate value to lean SMB teams compared to legacy incumbents.



# Differentiation & Value Proposition
The platform strictly differentiates itself through a 'Transparent AI Workflow.' Instead of acting as a black box, the system provides explicit, deterministic, 2-sentence justifications for every AI-generated candidate score, directly tying the candidate's extracted experience to the user-provided job description. This explicit explainability builds immediate trust, effectively addressing inherent HR compliance and bias concerns by maintaining the human-in-the-loop. Furthermore, by coupling this transparent screening with a one-click Chrome Extension sourcing tool, the platform drastically accelerates candidate ingestion, reducing overall time-to-hire and maximizing workflow efficiency.



# Risks & Mitigation
Risk 1: Vercel serverless timeouts during long-running AI processing and PDF extraction operations. Mitigation: Transitioned the architecture to offload all heavy compute to an asynchronous background worker queue via Inngest, ensuring guaranteed execution and zero blocked UI threads. Risk 2: High friction and blockages from native API scraping and enterprise B2B API negotiation delays. Mitigation: Implemented a client-side Chrome Extension for user-authenticated DOM extraction, shifting data ingress to the client. Risk 3: Runaway generative AI API costs destroying SaaS unit economics. Mitigation: Enforce strict Tiktoken budget caps per request prior to LLM execution, and strictly map API usage quotas directly to Stripe subscription tiers. Risk 4: Privacy compliance concerns regarding automated HR decision making. Mitigation: Ensure strict 'Zero Data Retention' configurations on OpenAI API endpoints and utilize Supabase Row Level Security (RLS) for tenant data isolation.
