# Executive Summary
The platform architecture guarantees zero blocked UI threads and complete protection from Vercel timeout limitations by delegating all LLM operations and PDF parsing to the Inngest background worker queue. Paired with a client-side Chrome Extension for sourcing, this stack fulfills the rigid 4-month MVP deadline while retaining strict multi-tenant isolation via Supabase RLS. By explicitly defining API boundaries and offloading state management to managed PostgreSQL, the team is empowered to ship rapidly with enterprise-grade resilience.



# Subsystems
**Name:** Next.js Serverless Orchestration Layer

**Objective:** Act as a thin orchestration client to manage UI rendering, user session states, and lightweight API routing.

**Implementation notes:** Leverage Next.js App Router with React Server Components for SEO and fast hydration. Use Edge API routes exclusively for lightweight requests and webhook receptions to maintain low latency.

**Name:** Supabase Managed Data & Auth Platform

**Objective:** Provide a foundational, highly secure Backend-as-a-Service layer for multi-tenant data storage, identity verification, and object storage.

**Implementation notes:** Utilize PostgreSQL with pgvector for unified relational and semantic data. Enforce strict Row Level Security (RLS) bound to GoTrue JWT custom claims for absolute tenant isolation. Use Supabase Storage for direct-from-client resume uploads.

**Name:** Inngest Async Worker Environment

**Objective:** Process heavy compute tasks (resume PDF parsing, OpenAI LLM inference) asynchronously without blocking Vercel serverless threads.

**Implementation notes:** Use Inngest for step-level execution logic, automatic retries, and exponential backoff. Integrate `tiktoken` middleware to calculate and validate LLM payloads prior to GPT-4o inference to protect budget constraints.

**Name:** Chrome Extension Sourcing Client

**Objective:** Bypass LinkedIn and Job Board API restrictions to ingest candidates directly from the user's browser.

**Implementation notes:** React-based content script pulling DOM structure, securely authenticated via the user's Next.js session, posting candidate JSON payloads to CORS-secured Next.js API endpoints.

# Architecture Overview
A highly resilient, event-driven, multi-tenant Serverless architecture utilizing Next.js as a thin orchestration client, Supabase for foundational data/auth, and Inngest for asynchronous processing of heavy AI tasks (PDF extraction, OpenAI inference), completely bypassing synchronous serverless execution limits.



# Delta Summary
Initial baseline established. Focus is on finalizing the event-driven decoupling strategy using Inngest and preparing schemas for pgvector and multi-tenant RLS.



# Iteration Notes
Ensure Zero Data Retention policy is mapped to OpenAI configurations via the API adapter. The project timeline rigidly dictates abandoning native Node BFF operations in favor of Edge routing and async workers.

# Feasibility Insights
Event-driven async architecture safely bypasses Vercel 10s serverless timeout limits, eliminating the highest technical risk for AI processing.

Chrome Extension mitigates the severe 6-12 month timeline risk associated with negotiating and implementing native B2B APIs for job boards.

Supabase RLS handles multi-tenant data isolation effectively, drastically reducing bespoke middleware security logic.



# Non-Functional Alignment
Security: Zero Data Retention enforced on OpenAI, ensuring candidate PII is not used for foundational model training.

Performance: Async background processing guarantees zero browser freezing, providing a highly responsive user interface during mass resume uploads.

Maintainability: Shifting extraction to the client reduces server-side scraping liabilities and localizes DOM-parsing updates.



# Outcome Alignment
Aligns the technical implementation strictly with the 4-month MVP, 3-person constraints. By removing long-tail API partnership dependencies and utilizing robust BaaS/async tooling, the team guarantees delivery of core AI intelligence capabilities without compromising system stability or SaaS unit economics.

# Primary KPIs
Monthly Recurring Revenue (MRR)

Weekly Active Workspaces (WAW)

Average Time Saved per Job Description (Target: 5+ hours)



# Guardrails
OpenAI API Cost < 15% of MRR

System Uptime > 99.9%

AI Output Override Rate < 10%



# Measurement Plan
Implement PostHog for granular frontend behavioral tracking and funnel drop-offs. Utilize Stripe webhooks as the financial source of truth for MRR. Monitor Vercel and Inngest logs continuously for background queue health, deadlock detection, and operational latency.



# Architecture Summary
System guarantees superior reliability, robust regulatory compliance, and rapid feature delivery by utilizing BaaS and decoupling compute. The strategic separation of long-running workflows into background queues enables standard Serverless deployments while protecting user experience.
